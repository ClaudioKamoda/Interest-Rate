Have you ever asked yourself if 12% a year is the same as 1% a month? (spoiler: it is not!)

Now you can have the answer easy and clean. Type your interest rate and select the time period and select the time period to convert it.

This project was created using React, Typescript, Styled Components and Redux with the intention of studing this technologies.
